In this presentation, understand how to use credit transactions through cards. We got more information behind the scenes, and several fast actions occur when you swipe,
insert, or tap your credit card in a business. The retail machine first transmits your card information to their bank, 
which forwards it to the Visa or Mastercard credit card network. It is then forwarded to your bank, sometimes referred to as the issuing bank, which verifies that you have sufficient funds or credit to complete the transaction. If everything is fine, your bank approves the transaction. Otherwise, it's declined. Along the way, the system also checks security to confirm the card owner is the person using the card. Once approved, the store sends all its settled transactions to its bank at the end of the day, and the actual money is moved from your bank to the store's bank. That final process is called settlement, and you'll see the charge on your credit card statement shortly.

To protect your transactions, there are a few key security features.  The first is the little metal chip on your card, known as the EMV chip.
It makes it difficult for hackers to repurpose stolen data by generating a fresh, distinct code for each transaction. 
Tokenization is an additional security measure that substitutes a fictitious number, or token, for your actual card number, 
particularly when you purchase online or through applications. This keeps your real card number safe. Additionally, by confirming that you are holding the card, the CVV code, a three-digit number on the back of your card, offers an additional degree of security while making transactions online. 
Provides an extra layer of protection while making purchases online by verifying that you are carrying the card. 
The two most popular methods are phishing and skimming. The practice of thieves placing tiny, covert devices on ATMs or card machines to obtain your card information as you swipe is known as "skimming." Phishing is the practice of criminals posing as your bank or another reliable source to deceive you into giving over your card information through phony emails, messages, or phone calls.  Banks use smart computer systems that get to know your normal spending habits to fight fraud. If something doesn't sound right, like an unusually expensive purchase from far out of your normal area, they might warn you, 
temporarily freeze the card, or ring you to ask you to confirm the purchase. Banks use artificial intelligence and machine learning to flag fraud very fast. All of these steps make credit card use safer for everyone.
