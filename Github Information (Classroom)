Github
People may save and share their coding work on the website GitHub. Consider Dropbox or Google Drive, but with a focus on computer code. On GitHub, you may work on your projects, save them, and even get help from others. Although software professionals use it extensively, other users include students, businesses, and hobbyists. The Git system serves as the foundation for GitHub. One tool that might help you monitor code changes is called Git. For example, Git can let you go back to a prior version of your work if you make a mistake while working on a huge application. This saves time and stress.

Repository (Repo)
A repository is similar to a folder in which your project exists. It has all the codes, pictures, and files belonging to that project. You may have any number of repositories you wish. Each time you make a change and push it into GitHub, it's a commit. Save it as a new copy of your work. You even left a note about what change you made.
 You submit your computer files to the GitHub website as you're working on them to commit your modifications to GitHub. You get the most recent version from GitHub whenever you want changes to be sent to your machine (maybe your buddy has contributed something new).
You may apply a new idea using a branch without changing the main project. You can include (add) the new idea to the primary project if it is acceptable. No damage if it doesn't; the primary project remains unaffected.


Request for Pull
You can ask to have a branch merged into the project once you're finished working on it. People call this a pull request. Other people can review your work, provide suggestions, or give their approval.

What Makes GitHub Beneficial?
Numerous people can work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with one another's work. Your creation is safely saved online, so you won't lose anything even if your machine malfunctions. You may look at other people's work, see how they write code, and even try your hand at their projects to learn.

Portfolio
Students may use GitHub to share their greatest work. They can showcase their GitHub connection as proof of their skills when applying for internships or employment. The majority of GitHub projects are "open source," meaning that anybody may use, alter, or share them without any limitations. It's a fantastic method to gain knowledge and become involved in real projects.
Programmers can find a home on GitHub. GitHub helps you save your code, examine changes, collaborate with others, and showcase your skills to the world, regardless of your level of programming experience. At first, it appears confusing, but with some use, it becomes straightforward and helpful.
